The Deep Learning Machinery (in computer vision) has several objectives: 
- demystify what is at stake in the "learning process" of deep-learning models
- build an incremental intuition of the machinery behind the scene
- allow people to think out of the box of current frameworks
- grasp the main concepts to design and build a computer vision framework from scratch

The order of articles publication is chronological. 
For a thematic order, please refer to the [Table of Contents](/table_of_contents/).

What is presented through the different articles is an understanding path. 
It is close to the path I actually followed some years ago, as I built my own computer vision 
framework from scratch without any skills in the domain. This is also the reason why I will not 
give any code example in any existing framework.

Feel free to interact through the different blog articles and to give any example of your own !

Disclaimer: I will try to use the least mathematical material needed and justify their use by intuition. 
The mathematical content mainly deals with: functions, derivative. 
Knowing about vectors and multivariate functions is a plus.
