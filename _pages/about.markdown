The Deep Learning Machinery (in computer vision) has several objectives: 
- demystify what is at stake in the "learning process" of deep-learning models
- build an incremental intuition of the machinery behind the scene
- allow people to think out of the box of current frameworks
- grasp the main concepts to design and build a computer vision framework

We will focus on one simple use case in computer vision, going deeper inside. 
We will then enlarge the point of vue staying in the computer vision field.

What is presented here is an understanding path. 
It is close to the path I actually followed some years ago, as I built my own computer vision 
framework from scratch without any skills in the domain. This is also the reason why I will not 
give any code example in any existing framework.

Feel free to interact through the different blog articles and to give any example of your own !
