## Deep-Learning meta walkthrough

### The Foundation

#### 1/ [General Concepts]({% post_url 2021-08-05-general-concepts %})

This is the first article of our walkthrough in deep-learning.
First things first, we explore some general concepts of deep-learning, introducing the deep-learning model.

#### 2/ [Inside the Model]({% post_url 2021-08-06-inside-the-model %})

In this article, we explore the generic structure of a deep-learning model.

### The Learning Process

#### 1/ [The Loss function]({% post_url 2021-08-09-loss-function %})

We complete the deep-learning model with the loss function: this is the first step toward the learning process.

#### 2/ [The Backward Pass]({% post_url 2021-08-13-backward-pass %})

The backward pass is the nemesis of the forward pass: this is the second step toward the learning process.

#### 3 / [The Weights]({% post_url 2021-08-19-weights %})

The weights are the learning elements of the deep-learning model: final step of the learning process.
