# Deep Learning Machinery in Computer Vision

The **Deep Learning Machinery** in Computer Vision has several objectives: 
- demystify what is at stake in the **learning process** of deep learning models
- build an incremental intuition of the machinery behind the scene
- think out of the box of current frameworks such as **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**
- grasp the main concepts to design and build a computer vision framework from scratch

# How to read?

## The [Blog](/blog/1)

The articles are presented from the newest to the latest. 
Reading the articles in the chronological order should be the way to go. 

This order should propose an understanding path. 
It is close to the path I actually followed some years ago, as I built my own computer vision 
framework from scratch. 

## The [Table of Contents](/table_of_contents/)

The articles are re organised into chapters.
We will elaborate on 4 main chapters: 

- In the `Deep Learning Meta Walkthrough` we explore the core of the **learning process**: 
**forward pass**, **backward pass** level 1, **weights update**...
- In `From a Layer Perspective`, we dig deeper into the **layers**: **neural structure**, 
**backward pass** level 2...
- In `From a Network Perspective`, we talk about deep learning models: **supervised**, **unsupervised**, 
**maximal activation**...
- In `From a Developer Perspective`, we elaborate on the steps needed to build a framework from scratch: 
**impact graphs**, **gradient checking**, **GPUs**...

# Disclaimer

I will not try and give any code example in the current existing frameworks: there are already many 
resources on the Internet.

I will try to use the least mathematical material needed and justify their use by intuition. 
The mathematical content mainly deals with: **functions**, **derivatives**. 
Knowing about **vectors** and **multivariate functions** is a plus.

In order for mathematically shy people not to feel overwhelmed, I will try to use these signs:  

![Warning](/_assets/images/maths/warning.png) means the content can be skipped after this sign

![Safe](/_assets/images/maths/safe.png) means reading should be safe after this sign
